# Bamazon
>In this activity, you'll be creating an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills you learned this unit. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. As a bonus task, you can program your app to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.

### Deployment

1. Clone repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Build database from `schema.sql` and `products.sql`
4. At command prompt run `node bamazonCustomer.js`
